# USB device geometries
#
# Usage:
#	UsbDevice Generic 1000	# a generic flash key sold as having 1GB
#
# This function will set NANO_MEDIASIZE, NANO_HEADS and NANO_SECTS for you.
#
# Note that the capacity of a flash key is usually advertised in MB or
# GB, *not* MiB/GiB. As such, the precise number of cylinders available
# for C/H/S geometry may vary depending on the actual flash geometry.
#
# The following generic device layouts are understood:
#  generic           An alias for generic-hdd.
#  generic-hdd       255H 63S/T xxxxC with no MBR restrictions.
#  generic-fdd       64H 32S/T xxxxC with no MBR restrictions.
#
# The generic-hdd device is preferred for flash devices larger than 1GB.
